# Investment-Platform

The application simulates an invetment platform which supports trading, earn/dividend programs and analysis over transactions.

Through the menu, you can do CRUD operations for User, Exchange, Asset and Wallet. For faster testing, you can choose to seed the app with data or to delete your progress.

In Other Functions, if you have an existing user and an exchange, you can enter in Simulation Mode where you can play with specific methods.
